# Social Network API
Github repo: https://github.com/Ms-Marlena/social-network-api
## Description
I built this project to learn how to store information about users of a  social network, to allow them to add friends, post thoughts, and post reactions to their friend's  thoughts. 
During this project, I learned more about building routes in Mongo, modularization and exporting components, to make it easier to read and debug the code.
